# Summary

<font size="5"><span style="color: red;">Please note: all data presented here is simulated and for demonstration purposes only. The modelling approach was not intended to reflect the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></font>

108 sites across three countries have registered to enter data using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) COVID-19 Clinical Characterisation Data Tool.  Up to 11 March 2020, data have been entered for 400 patients. There has been a recent reduction in recruitment, with only one patient recruited in the past week.  Follow-up is ongoing for 72 patients.  315 patients have recovered and 13 have died. 

The most common symptoms on presentation were cough (345, 86%) and shortness of breath (199, 50%), and 371 (93%) had at least one of those symptoms. 351 patients were admitted to hospital.  Older age and a history of smoking were associated with a greater risk of admission to hospital.  Length of hospital stay varied with age, with the greatest stay being for those aged 60 to 70 years (24 days, 95% CI: 16 – 31) and the shortest for those aged 30 to 40 (3 days, 95% CI: 1 – 11). 

No patients in this dataset were admitted to intensive care.  26 (7%) patients required non-invasive ventilation.  A history of asthma was the strongest predictor of requiring non-invasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI: 2.8 – 4.7).
